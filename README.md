# Dijkstra-Shortest-Path-Python
"Dijkstra-Shortest-Path-Python" is a repository with a Python implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. It's a valuable resource for developers interested in pathfinding and optimization.


Dijkstra's Algorithm: Shortest Path in a Graph
This repository showcases an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using Python. Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

Problem Description
The problem we aim to solve is finding the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. Given a graph represented by its nodes and edges, along with the weights assigned to each edge, we want to determine the shortest path from a given source node to a target node.

Approach
Dijkstra's algorithm works by iteratively visiting nodes, starting from the source node, and updating the distance to reach each node. It maintains a priority queue of nodes based on their tentative distances from the source. At each step, the algorithm selects the node with the minimum tentative distance and explores its neighboring nodes, updating their distances if a shorter path is found.

The algorithm continues until it has visited all reachable nodes or until the target node is reached. Once the algorithm terminates, the shortest path from the source to the target can be reconstructed by following the predecessors from the target node back to the source node.

Implementation Details
The implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm provided here utilizes the following components:

dijkstra(graph, start): This function takes the graph and the starting node as inputs and returns a dictionary containing the shortest distances from the start node to all other nodes in the graph.
Usage
To use this implementation, follow these steps:

Define your graph by representing it as a dictionary of dictionaries, where each key represents a node, and the corresponding value is a dictionary of its neighboring nodes and their edge weights.
Call the dijkstra(graph, start) function, passing in your graph and the desired start node.
The function will return a dictionary with the shortest distances from the start node to all other nodes in the graph.
Utilize the result to find the shortest path or extract any other relevant information.
Example
Consider the following example:

python
Copy code
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 5, 'C': 2},
    'B': {'A': 5, 'C': 1, 'D': 3},
    'C': {'A': 2, 'B': 1, 'D': 2},
    'D': {'B': 3, 'C': 2, 'E': 4},
    'E': {'D': 4}
}

start_node = 'A'
distances = dijkstra(graph, start_node)

print("Shortest distances from node", start_node + ":")
for node, distance in distances.items():
    print("To", node + ":", distance)
This example demonstrates the usage of the provided implementation on a sample graph. The output will display the shortest distances from the start node ('A') to all other nodes ('B', 'C', 'D', 'E').
